### Responsive 3D Coffee Landing Page with animations
Beautiful landing page website UI, and built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains a header and a home section with a title, a description and animated button, as well as a 3D image with mouse movement.

A layout created with css grids and flexboxes. Also I practiced using css variables. Such an approach helped me to experiment with colors a bit until I was happy with design. Using rems for fonts and dimentions is a modern approach to build responsive layout.
